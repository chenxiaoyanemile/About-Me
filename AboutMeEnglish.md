# Hey, I'm Emily !

I'm an **android developer**, novel enthusiast, and graduated from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine based in Guangzhou, China. I love to create, and writing software is my favorite way to stay busy.

Most of my software is open source, and I encourage you to check out my work on my GitHub page. I'm also happy to connect via chenxiaoyanemile@gmail.com.
